# Repository for GitHub Issue Label Study Data

## _Kim, Jindae, and Seonah Lee. "An empirical study on using multi-labels for issues in github." IEEE Access 9 (2021): 134984-134997._

## Abstract
Labels on the platform GitHub are commonly used to capture various pieces of information and decisions related to reported issues. Despite this, prior research has largely focused only on simple statistics or recommending single labels. This study aims to deepen our understanding of label usage by specifically examining multiple and custom labels applied to issues. We collected data from GitHub projects—including label usage metrics—and conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our quantitative results show that multi-label usage is common in most software projects and that projects utilizing multi-labels tend to manage their issues more effectively. Qualitatively, we identified distinct categories of multi-labels (related to features, development, issues, etc.) and explored how they are used in practice. The findings provide actionable insights for issue tracking and suggest improvements for labeling techniques to reduce the overhead of issue management.
